## Risk Factors
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, including our financial statements, the notes thereto and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects, as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.

The risk for this investment is actually quite low, as the company is being managed by a team of passionate and trained individuals in their field. The credit rating of each and every individual is high, as well as the credit for each and every LLC, and finally the credit for the managing C-CORP is of utmost importance to preserve, as the availabilty of low-interest loans will improve the business process in all aspects. Furthermore, the company pledges to transparently publish its financial statements to investors, as well as other internal company documents (not including sensative personal data), so investors may have full assurance that their investment is safe.

## Use of Proceeds
We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of 4,000 shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $884,000 based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $221 per share. The majority of the raised principal will be used as a down-payment towards a commercial property, which will be used as a corporate office. Approximately 10% of the proceeds will go towards equipment and inventory for the office (this includes desktops, servers, mousepads and other accessories). A total of six (6) workspaces will be alloted at the corporate offices for the President (CEO), Project Manager (PM), Software Developer, Treasurer (CFO), , Engineer, and Designer. A total of ten (10) created jobs is the total goal for the IPO, which includes the previous mentioned positions plus: Secrerary, Site-Manager (COO), Vice-President (VP), and Engineer. General liability insurance will be purchased, as well as workers-comp insurance. Furthermore, for marketing, Google, Facebook, and Linkedin ADs will be purchased. We hope to give each $1,000 per year. We will also purchase Cloud services, as this workspace will employ hybrid cloud solutions. The cloud companies to be used are Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud. Some of the proceeds will also go to legal fees, to assure the company has a rock-solid legal complience.    

## Funding Goal
Our ultimate goal in this IPO campaign is to raise $5 million in capital for the purchase of business property, inventory, utillities, insurance and employee wages. With the purchase of the commercial property, we intend to sub-lease unused space to other businesses, this generating more revenue for investors.

## Offering Price

* The offering price for preferred (private) stock will initially be set at $300/share.

However, the underwriter is not required to take or pay for the shares of common stock covered by the underwriter’s option to purchase additional common stock as described below.

Our common stock are offered subject to a number of conditions, including:

* receipt and acceptance of our common stock by the underwriter; and
* the underwriter’s right to reject orders in whole or in part.

In connection with this offering, the underwriter or securities dealers may distribute prospectuses electronically.

## Electronic Distribution
A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on websites or through other online services maintained by the underwriter of this offering, or by their affiliates. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter’s website and any information contained in any other website maintained by an underwriter is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or any underwriter in its capacity as underwriter, and should not be relied upon by investors.

## Price Stabilization, Short Positions
In connection with this offering, the underwriter may engage in activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our common stock during and after this offering, including:
* stabilizing transactions;
* short sales;
* purchases to cover positions created by short sales;
* imposition of penalty bids; and
* syndicate covering transactions.

Stabilizing transactions consist of bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock while this offering is in progress. Stabilization transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. These transactions may also include making short sales of our common stock, which involve the sale by the underwriter of a greater number of common stock than they are required to purchase in this offering and purchasing common stock on the open market to cover short positions created by short sales. Short sales may be “covered short sales,” which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares referred to above, or may be “naked short sales,” which are short positions in excess of that amount.

The underwriter may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option, in whole or in part, or by purchasing shares in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriter will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option.

Naked short sales are short sales made in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriter must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriter is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchased in this offering.

The underwriter also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriter a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Maxim has repurchased shares sold by or for the account of that underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These stabilizing transactions, short sales, purchases to cover positions created by short sales, the imposition of penalty bids and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result of these activities, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriter may carry out these transactions on the Nasdaq Capital Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor the underwriter make any representation or prediction as to the effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the shares. Neither we, nor the underwriter make any representation that the underwriter will engage in these stabilization transactions or that any transaction, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

## Determination of Offering Price
Prior to this offering, there was no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiation between us and Maxim. The principal factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price include, but not limited to:
* the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to Ruff Management Inc.
* our history and prospects and the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;
* our past and present financial performance;
* our prospects for future earnings and the present state of our development;
* the general condition of the securities market at the time of this offering;
* the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded shares of generally comparable companies; and
* other factors deemed relevant by the underwriter and us.

The estimated public offering price range set forth on the cover page of this preliminary prospectus is subject to change as a result of market conditions and other factors. Neither we nor the underwriter can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our common stock or that the common stock will trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price.
